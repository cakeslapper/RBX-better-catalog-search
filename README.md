# RBX-better-catalog-search
My experiment in creating a better search function for roblox clothes, which is ruined by millions of copied clothes and inaccurate, spammed keyword descriptions.

### What it does:
- Searches & shows only unique clothes (solves problem of duplicates)

### Current problems with the script:
- [ ] Runs slowly
- [ ] Does nothing against inaccurately labeled clothes

### Upcoming features:
- [ ] Optimizations for speed
- [ ] More accurate results
- [ ] Code hosted on its own site
